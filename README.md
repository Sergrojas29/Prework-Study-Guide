# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Prework Study Guide was created for two main reasons: 
--One, was to have firsthand practice with basic elements need to create a website from the frame up. 
--Second was to have a place to hold my notes on the subjects we reviewed (HTML, CSS, Git & JavaScript).


Building this project, I learned a great deal of base information:
GitBash workflow to create a version control with the use of special git commands. With HTML I learned to create the basic framework of a website. Then with CSS I used to create a style that could be linked back to the index.html file. And finally, JavaScript was reviewed to be able to interact with my website. 

Thought the project I was able to fix problems that were simulated like JavaScript variable naming errors. And Problems that come with jumping into something new. 
Git .ssh was the first. Some syntax errors created when I connect a second computer to my SSH keys on my github profile. Lucky comparing the id_ed25519.pub with both my first computer and Canvas module resolved the issue. Another issue arose when I prepared to commit for the first time through git bash. I need to add a global user to my PC. For this issue I search web for the answer using the error message I received. After inputting my user.email & user.name with the correct git command I was able to continue.
With html my biggest issue was how to add "<>" to my notes. As well as typing out li> /li> was too slow. I will try to find a solution though an extension or maybe a one of my classmates will have more knowledge on the subject. I did try to search for the answer but after some time I decided that I lost too much time search and to progress with the rest of the html file. At the end I used excel to create a format for the notes that would use concat() to connect the end closing tags for me.
With CSS they only issue was there was some much I could do with the style that I only test and did not implement to the .css file.
Finally, I had the least issue with JavaScript. Having learn basic c++ helped me move through the modules faster. 
 
I hope to be able to return to add more notes and use further knowledge to create a perfect study guide for me mainly to match my learning style. Since in this case Ill be the main end user I want it to have more visual elements, sense of design and set standards to be easily viewed.
